## Abstract
Bintrong game is a designed to be a free accessable game for students to study questions using competition. A key goal is take make the solution freeware so anyone can host it for free. The plan is for the game application to provide options for generating card packs via LLM. The intent behind this project is to encourage competition in order to trick users into studying. The game will be designed to be short review games based around some form of parkour or survival scenario. The player's objective will be to control his or her character and select the correct answer based on the game. For instance, my first game will involve parkour where the user is required to jump on the platform with the correct answer. Jumping onto the wrong question will result in a penalty for the player.

## Current Inadequacy
Existing tooling is not self hostable and locks key features behind paywalls. There are no existing anki projects that are used with my tooling design. The existing tools require external software installation.

## Technical Backround
I have experience working on game personal projects and work with a variety of web technologies daily.
