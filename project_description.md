## Abstract
Bintrong game is a designed to be a free accessable game for students to study questions using competition. A key goal is take make the solution freeway so anyone can host it for free. The plan is for the game application to provide options for generating card packs via LLM.

## Current Inadequacy
Existing tooling is not self hostable and locks key features behind paywalls. There are no existing anki projects that are used with my tooling design. The existing tools require external software installation.

## Technical Backround
I have experience working on game personal projects and work with a variety of web technologies daily.
