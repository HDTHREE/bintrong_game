There are some econmic constraints for this project. The two main costs are hosting the game application and hosting the LLM inference server. Public deployment is going to be neccessary to fully demonstrate the application. There are currently no plans to monetize the application and it will be shared as freeway available on github. I will need to spend some amount of money to host the game. The application interface for inferencing with the LLM should be made designed in a way it can interface with a publicly hosted LLMs.
There are a few general security concerns. This application includes a file upload and storage feature so the backend will need propery authenication security. The implemention for how the backend spawns the gameserver(s) will important to avoid abuse.
There aren't any real legal concerns for this application. I won't be using any propriety assets or software. Educators are free to use this application in the classroom.
