# Timing
I am starting this with 5 weeks remaining total in the semester, so I will be working all day and all night. However, most contributions will be done over the weekends due to my dayjob.

## Workflow and Deployment
I plan to deploy locally and provide docker deployment instructions for prod. The majority of the initial work will just be pushed to master and I do not plan to do PRs for myself. However, I will still create feature branches during development.

# Project
A fullstack web application to test and generate anki flashcards. I am Hayden and will be the sole developer and project manager.

## Theme
The theme of the game will be a survival style game with limited lives. The intention would be that the game is *difficult* and will require high question accuracy under time constraint. The playable character is going to be a bintrong also known as the bearcat. The game should be able to be played with up to 30 players in a multiplayer setting. The most similar style (non-study) game would be Fall Guys or Crab Game.
