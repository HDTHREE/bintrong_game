# Timing
I am starting this with 5 weeks remaining total in the semester, so I will be worked all day and all night. However, most contributions will be done over the weekends due to my dayjob.

# Project
A fullstack web application to test and generate anki flashcards. I am Hayden and will be the sole developer and project manager.

## Theme
The theme of the game will be a survival style game with limited lives. The intention would be that the game is *difficult* and will require high question accuracy under time constraint. The playable character is going to be a bintrong. The game should be able to be player with up to 10 players in a multiplayer setting. The most similar style (non-study) game would be Fall Guys or Crab Game.
